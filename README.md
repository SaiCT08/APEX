# APEX
Implements an extensible arbitrary-precision arithmetic engine via digit-vector partitioning, recursive carry-propagation lattices, radix-normalized summand realignment, and convergence harmonization, ensuring deterministic overflow-free summation with scalability for cryptographic and combinatorial computation. Adds radix-k param, metrics, traces.
